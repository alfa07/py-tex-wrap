Writing this summary was difficult, because there were no large themes in the last two
weeks of discussion. Instead there were lots and lots of small items; as
the release date for 2.0b1 nears, people are concentrating on resolving
outstanding patches, fixing bugs, and making last-minute tweaks. Computes
a Adler-32 checksum of string. (An Adler-32 checksum is
almost as reliable as a CRC32 but can be computed much more
quickly.) If value is present, it is used as the starting
value of the checksum; otherwise, a fixed
default value is used. This allows
computing a running checksum
over the concatenation
of several input strings.
The algorithm is not
cryptographically strong,
and should not be used
for authentication or digital
signatures.
